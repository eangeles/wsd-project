	<h3> Basic Info </h3>
	
	<p> <article>The Shih-Tzu is a small, sturdy dog, with a body that is slightly longer than it is tall. 
	The head is round and broad, wide between the eyes. The square muzzle is short, an inch or 
	less from the tip of the nose to the defined stop. The nose is broad, with well open 
	nostrils. Nose, lips, and eye rims are liver on liver colored dogs and blue on blue dogs and 
	black on all other colors. The teeth meet in a level or under bite. The large, round eyes 
	are dark in color, but lighter on blue and liver dogs. The large, pendant, low-set ears hang 
	down and are covered in abundant hair. The back is level. The muscular legs are straight and
	well-boned. The high-set tail is carried over the back covered in abundant hair. Dewclaws are 
	sometimes removed. The double coat is dense and long, flowing down over the dog. The hair 
	above the eyes is often tied in a topknot. There is a profuse beard and mustache and the hair 
	on the muzzle is short. Coat comes in all colors.</p></article>
